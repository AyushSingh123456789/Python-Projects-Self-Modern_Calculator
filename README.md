Hello, Myself Ayush Singh, 1st year Engineering student, currently learning Python.
I have created this Modern Calculator which can calculate- Maintainence Calorie of a Person, Basic Arithmetics, Mental Health Condition, Productivity of the day. 
This was created by using the most basic and core concepts of Python, and therefore it can look very lengthy and unclean.
The main Focus was just creating a project using the most basic concepts of Python, everything else was just secondary.
